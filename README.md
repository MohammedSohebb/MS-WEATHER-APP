# MS-WEATHER-APP  (a project for FRT internship)

The weather app is a simple web application that allows users to enter a city name and retrieve weather details for that city, including the temperature, humidity, and wind speed for a specific city. 
The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the Fetch API to retrieve data from the OpenWeather API.

# Description

 Many people around the world are affected by weather conditions on a daily basis. However, it can be challenging for individuals to access accurate and up-to-date weather information for their local area. While there are many weather apps and websites available, they can often be cluttered and difficult to navigate, and may not provide the specific information that users are looking for.
 
 The weather app project provides an opportunity to create a simple and user-friendly web application that allows users to quickly and easily retrieve weather details for a specific city. The app uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data, and displays the information in a visually appealing way using Font Awesome icons. By providing a clean and modern user interface, the app makes it easy for users to access the weather information they need, without the clutter and complexity of traditional weather apps and websites. Additionally, by leveraging Azure services such as Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Maps, the app can be deployed and hosted quickly and easily, with the potential to scale and expand in the future. Overall, the weather app project provides a valuable opportunity to create a simple and effective solution for accessing weather information online.
 
 Certainly!  The weather app project uses two Azure services: Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Maps.
